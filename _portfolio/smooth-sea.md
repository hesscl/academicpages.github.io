A working paper that introduces a spatial and non-spatial forecasting models for census tract rent estimates in Seattle, WA. The Bayesian models used as forecasting candidates in this paper draw on different error structures to predict quarterly rent levels among the 134 census tracts in Seattle. This estimation method is useful given the missingness and low listing counts among some tracts in the panel. The model with the best accuracy on both training and test data incorporates non-spatial and spatial random effects for tracts along with autoregressive (order 1) and exchangeable random effects for quarters.
