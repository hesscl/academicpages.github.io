The goals of this research memo are two-fold. One task is to establish and provide social scientists with a crosswalk table linking county-subdivisions (in New England) and counties (everywhere else in the U.S.) to the appropriate metropolitan boundaries at each decennial census from 1970 to 2010. The other objective is to compare Dissmilarity Index measures of residential segregation between historical and present-day Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA) delineations in an effort to show the extent to which the boundary-setting has substantive implications in one common application.
