I'm a 5th-year graduate student in Sociology and Demography at the University of Washington. My research interests center around residential segregation, urban growth and place-based inequalities. I have published research in _Urban Affairs Review_. My work has a quantitative focus, and I am a big proponent of the R language for statistical analysis and data visualization. I ‚ù§ ggplot2.

My dissertation investigates the importance of rising suburban poverty for processes of residential mobility and neighborhood segregation. Empirical analyses draw on Census data and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics [(PSID)](http://psid.org).

The chapters of this work focus on:
  1. describing the spatial structure of metropolitan areas using location types for city, older suburb, newer suburb and rural areas
  2. decomposing metropolitan segregation by race and ethnicity into components for segregation within or between locations of a metropolitan area.
  3. modeling how stratified patterns of suburban residential mobility underpin racial and ethnic disparities in exposure to suburban neighborhood poverty
