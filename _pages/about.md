I am a 4th-year graduate student in Sociology and Demography at the University of Washington-Seattle. My substantive interests center around residential segregation, urban growth and place-based inequalities. I currently have work in publication at _Urban Affairs Review_.

My dissertation takes on the importance of suburban poverty for changing forms of racial/ethnic inequalities in neighborhood context. Throughout this work, I quantitatively analyze micro- and macro-dynamics related to rising neighborhood poverty rates and the overall concentration of poverty within different types of suburbs. These analyses draw on Census data and the Panel [Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)][psid.org]. 

The chapters of this work focus on:
  a. the metropolitan characteristics associated with trends of rising neighborhood poverty rates and concentration of poverty
  b. the household-level mechanisms through we observe racial/ethnic disparities in exposure to neighborhood poverty in suburbs 
  c. the socioeconomic implications of living in poor suburban neighborhoods (relative to other suburban neighborhoods and also poor central-city neighborhoods).
