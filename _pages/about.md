I'm currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at Rutgers University---Camden in the Center for Urban Research Education and Department of Public Policy and Administration, having recently received my Ph.D in Sociology at the University of Washington. My research interests focus on residential segregation, urban growth and the changing spatial distribution of place-based inequalities. I have published research in _Urban Affairs Review_ and _Demography_ have forthcoming work with coauthors at _Cityscape_. My work has a quantitative focus, and I am a big proponent of the R language for statistical analysis and data visualization. I ‚ù§ ggplot2.

My dissertation investigates the importance of rising suburban poverty for processes of residential mobility and neighborhood segregation. Empirical analyses draw on Census data and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics [(PSID)](http://psid.org).

The chapters of this work focus on:
  1. describing the spatial structure of metropolitan areas and neighborhood poverty using location types for city, older suburb, newer suburb and rural areas
  2. decomposing metropolitan segregation by race and ethnicity into components for segregation within or between locations of a metropolitan area.
  3. modeling how stratified patterns of suburban residential mobility underpin racial and ethnic disparities in exposure to suburban neighborhood poverty
