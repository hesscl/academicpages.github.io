I'm a 5th-year graduate student in Sociology and Demography at the University of Washington. My research interests center around residential segregation, urban growth and place-based inequalities. I have published research in _Urban Affairs Review_. My work has a quantitative focus, and I am a big proponent of the R language for statistical analysis and data visualization. I ‚ù§ ggplot2.

My dissertation investigates the importance of rising suburban poverty for processes of residential mobility and neighborhood segregation. Empirical analyses draw on Census data and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics [(PSID)](http://psid.org).

The chapters of this work focus on:
  1. the metropolitan characteristics and forms of residential segregation associated with trends of rising neighborhood poverty rates
  2. how residential mobility and "in place" neighborhood change both explain racial and ethnic disparities in exposure to suburban neighborhood poverty
  3. the neighborhood disadvantages in poor suburban neighborhoods (relative to other suburban neighborhoods and also poor central-city neighborhoods)
