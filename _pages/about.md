I am a 4th-year graduate student in Sociology and Demography at the University of Washington-Seattle. My substantive interests center around residential segregation, urban growth and place-based inequalities, and I have published work in _Urban Affairs Review_.

My dissertation takes on the importance of suburban poverty for understanding changing forms of racial/ethnic inequalities in neighborhood context. In the chapters of this work, I quantitatively analyze micro- and macro-dynamics related to rising rates of neighborhood poverty and concentration of poor households in these contexts. The chapters of this work focus on a.) the metropolitan characteristics related to different degrees and forms of suburban poverty, b.) the household-level mechanisms through we observe racial/ethnic disparities in exposure to neighborhood poverty in suburbs and c.) the socioeconomic implications of living in poor suburban neighborhoods (relative to other suburban neighborhoods and also poor central-city neighborhoods).
