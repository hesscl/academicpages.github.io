This course, taught by Dr. Stew Tolnay, reviews the logical and methodological foundations of social science research. Important aspects of this course include how to formulate a social science research question, understand the logic behind hypothesis testing, and consider concepts like reliability and validity as they relate to resarch design. 

My role for this course was to handle administrative items like quiz preparation, grading and managing the clicker-based participation system.
