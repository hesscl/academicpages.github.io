This course reviews the methodological foundations of social science research. Important topics include hypothesis testing, reliability/validity and survey sampling designs. 

Students have the opportunity to utilize the General Social Survey data made available by the University of California Berkeley's Social Data Analysis (SDA) web application for a course project. This assignment gives many undergraduate students their first exposure to conducting social research, and allows them to implement course concepts within their guided research project.
